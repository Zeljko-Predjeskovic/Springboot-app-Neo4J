/**
 * # Spring boot Neo4J
 * 
 * The first thing to ask, if we want to build an application is, which database
 * do we want to use?
 *
 * My decision felt on Neo4j and there is plenty of reasons why. Neo4j is a
 * database that stores the data in a graph structure instead of tables.
 *
 * It has great performance thanks to their fast queries which can be useful
 * for lots of data since we are making a social media model.
 * Another great reason to use Neo4j are the relations.
 * Perfect for our use case we can define complex relations and still be flexible.
 *
 * # Neo4j installation and setup
 *
 *
 * # Connection with springboot app
 *
 * Let's get started with some coding
