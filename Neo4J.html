<p>The first thing to ask, if we want to build an application is, which database
do we want to use?</p>
<p>My decision felt on Neo4j and there is plenty of reasons why. Neo4j is a
database that stores the data in a graph structure instead of tables.</p>
<p>It has great performance thanks to their fast queries which can be useful for
lots of data since we are making a social media model. Another great reason
to use Neo4j are the relations. Perfect for our use case we can define
complex relations and still be flexible.</p>
<h3 id="neo4j-installation-and-setup">Neo4j installation and setup</h3>
<p>Browse for Neo4j community edition and install the desktop version. You have
to expose some of your personal information and accept the license but thats
nothing new.</p>
<p>After the installation open neo4j desktop. It should look like this:</p>
<p>You could just use some HTML in your Markdown:</p>
<p><img src="./images/neo4jdesktop.PNG" alt="n4jdesktop" width="450px"/></p>
<p>The Movie Database is a default one. You can start it to explore a little of
the graph db environment. Hover over your database and click on start. You
can choose how to open the db, I am using the browser. The default username
is &quot;neo4j&quot; and password is &quot;secret&quot;. You can go on details and change the
password.</p>
<p>If you are done with the exploration, you can create a new empty database. We
will use this one for our connection to our spring boot app</p>
<h3 id="connect-with-springboot-app">Connect with springboot app</h3>
<p>Define your Neo4j connection in src/main/resources/application.properties</p>
<pre><code> spring.data.neo4j.uri=bolt://localhost:7687 // your connection path
 spring.data.neo4j.username=neo4j // database username
 spring.data.neo4j.password=secret // database password</code></pre>
<p>The value written in this example is the default connection. You actually
don&#39;t have to write anything if you use a default connection. Notice that
Neo4j uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolt_(network_protocol">Bolt</a>)
network protocol to connect. It will not acceptt a http connection.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s get started with some coding</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
