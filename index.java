 *
 * ### Introduction
 *
 * Hello, my name is Zeljko Predjeskovic and I am currently a student who
 * studies computer science. I really love trying out new stuff especially when
 * it comes to backend engineering. This project aims to build a web api that
 * can be used for social media apps. Keep in mind that I am still a student and
 * that this project will be far beyond from perfect. I will make sure to share
 * my thinking so you can understand my processes.
 *
 * ### Overview
 *
 * Working my first time with Neo4j, a nosql graph database I am really excited.
 * My plans and topics are:
 *
 * - Neo4j and its connection
 * 
 * - Object Mapping
 * 
 * - Repositories
 * 
 * - Service
 * 
 * - Presentation/Controller
 * 
 * - Security
 * 
 * - Web/Controller
 *
 * I will talk about each one of this section on how I write the code, What
 * problems do I have, how am I solving them and of course a bit of theory.
